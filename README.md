## Final Project Topic: The Analysis of Transcriptomic Variations in ALS and FTD 

Utilizing single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human brain samples, I explored cell-type-
specific molecular alterations prevalent in donors afflicted with C9-ALS or C9-FTD. It emerged
that diverse cellular populations within localized cell types show apparent genetic signatures. A
convergence of gene expression patterns between these two debilitating conditions was revealed,
with discernible differences emerging, particularly in the FTD category, hinting at the presence
of unique expression signatures exclusive to FTD. This segmentation into cell type categories
unveils distinctive gene expression patterns specific to neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial
cells.
